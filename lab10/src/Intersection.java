// Maintain two pointers pA and pB initialized at the head of A and B, respectively.
// Then let them both traverse through the lists, one node at a time.
// When pA reaches the end of a list, then redirect it to the head of B (yes, B, that's right.);
// similarly when pB reaches the end of a list, redirect it the head of A.
// If at any point pA meets pB, then pA/pB is the intersection node.
// To see why the above trick would work, consider the following two lists:
// A = {1,3,5,7,9,11} and B = {2,4,9,11}, which are intersected at node '9'.
// Since B.length (=4) < A.length (=6), pB would reach the end of the merged list first, because pB traverses exactly 2 nodes less than pA does.
// By redirecting pB to head A, and pA to head B, we now ask pB to travel exactly 2 more nodes than pA would.
// So in the second iteration, they are guaranteed to reach the intersection node at the same time.
// If two lists have intersection, then their last nodes must be the same one.
// So when pA/pB reaches the end of a list, record the last element of A/B respectively.
// If the two last elements are not the same one, then the two lists have no intersections.
//
// Complexity Analysis
//
// Time complexity : O(m+n).
// Space complexity : O(1).
